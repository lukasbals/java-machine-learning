# Machine learning with Java

This is the repository for my bachelor thesis. In the thesis, three machine learning
frameworks for java are compared. To compare the frameworks and algorithms the MNIST
dataset is used. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 handwritten letters to learn and
10,000 handwritten letters to test the results.
